										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Harrison Carloss, the strategic creative agency with over 40 years of successful marketing know-how to its name, has boosted its digital and creative design team with the addition of some fresh new talent.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chelsea joins the agency as a front end developer, while Chris brings with him digital design skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following a year’s web design at one of the UK&amp;I’s largest technology distribution and specialist service providers, <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/team/chelsea-colclough/">Chelsea</a> was lead digital designer at Staffordshire University. She then spent 18 months as a front end web developer working on websites, SEO, DMS, lead management and online sales software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before joining HC, and following a 1<sup>st</sup> class honours design degree at Staffordshire University, <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/team/chris-mobley/">Chris</a> won a young super yacht designer award in 2018. He then did design work on yachts in Falmouth, and subsequently worked in a design and project management role in the Midlands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The addition of Chelsea and Chris further strengthens the agency’s in-house creative, web and digital capabilities, and augments an already impressive team of designers, developers, inventors, strategists, artists and storytellers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Staffordshire’s oldest established and longest running creative agency, Harrison Carloss are renowned for producing a long series of <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/projects/">highly successful campaigns</a> for many well-known global, national and regional brands, gathering many awards and achievements along the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last 18 months Harrison Carloss has enjoyed an extraordinary period of expansion that has seen significant growth in the agency’s client list, together with an increase in the digital side of the business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are very pleased to say that the agency has weathered the Covid-19 storm remarkably well and, true to form, we have been supporting clients and businesses with a a full range of marketing services which include <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/website-design-and-development/">web design</a>, branding and marketing strategy, direct mail, advertising, design for print and print management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Said Harrison Carloss MD Adam Mobley, “We’re absolutely delighted to welcome Chelsea and Chris to our highly talented team. I’ve no doubt that with their abilities we can build on our achievements over the past 18  months, and continue to deliver the very best for our existing and new clients.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, not really… <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/team/adam-mobley/">Adam</a> has been the MD of Harrison Carloss for a while now, but we have officially separated from <a href="http://myclevergroup.com/">My Clever Group</a>. It’s been an amazing 18 months as part of the Group but it’s time we flew the nest.</p>
<p>We’ve achieved such a lot in such a short space of time; we fully rebranded to Harrison Carloss, <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/harrison-carloss-takes-on-yet-more-top-talent/">gained new team members</a>, put in a huge amount of time and effort to enhance our digital, web design and web development services, produced some outstanding work for clients to build on our long reputation as a leading creative agency, and, most importantly, we gained some lovely new clients along the way.</p>
<p>“It’s been fantastic seeing Harrison Carloss go from strength to strength over the last 18 months,” he said, “Knowing that I’ve played a central role in that journey along with the team. With a background in design and technology, it’s something that I’m personally passionate about.”</p>
<p>At the time of Adam’s management buyout, we had already grown our portfolio of clients significantly under his leadership and direction, working with a number of well-known businesses both locally and nationwide since our rebrand. Adam will now continue in his role as Managing Director, taking on full commercial responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the business.</p>
<p>Gareth also commented: “I’m a huge believer in the power of marketing. It was undoubtedly a significant factor in helping us to build my previous business, <a href="https://www.solidor.co.uk/">Solidor</a> into the high growth, well-known business that it was then and still is to this day. The team at Harrison Carloss, led by Adam, have already achieved such a lot in a short amount of time, and I’ll continue to support the business with its plans for growth.”</p>
<h6>So what’s next for Staffordshire’s longest running creative marketing agency?</h6>
<p>Says Adam, “I’m now looking forward to building on the agency’s past successes and continuing to push the business forward, to deliver the very best for clients, both existing and new, in the future.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>It’s been a strange few weeks here at Harrison Carloss HQ (and by that we mean our respective homes), so it was really welcomed when we got the incredibly exciting news that we had been shortlisted for <a href="https://www.recommendedawards.com/">The Drum Recommends Awards 2020</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Unlike other awards, The Drum Recommends is based solely on <a href="https://www.recommendedagencies.com/harrison-carloss/?">reviews</a> from our lovely, real-life clients, so this really means a lot to us!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>What is The Drum?</h6>
<p>The Drum is Europe’s largest media and marketing website, attracting over 1.4 million unique users and over 200,00 social followers each month. They pride themselves on helping businesses make informed decisions about their marketing and showcasing the best of the best.</p>
<p>The Drum Recommends Awards is a highlight for a number of agencies. Differing from other awards, they are based entirely on the ratings and reviews of an agency’s clients which are collected on The Drum’s <a href="https://www.recommendedagencies.com/">Recommended Agencies</a> website – no entries to submit or papers to write!</p>
<p>The award covers a number of discipline and service categories – we have been nominated for our vibrant and powerful print! We have worked on a number of exciting print projects over the last year that have really allowed us to test our creative muscles. From design to distribution, Harrison Carloss have always been at the forefront of <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/services/print/">print</a>, so to get this recognition means so much to the team. Who said print is dead? Not us!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Party in our PJs!</h6>
<p>We’re incredibly proud of the whole team, as well as the amazing clients we’ve worked with who have allowed us to showcase our talents, and have a lot of fun doing it! The winners will be announced at the end of April – without the opportunity for Harrison Carloss outing, unfortunately! Nonetheless, we are excited to find out whether we have an excuse to crack open the fancy isolation drinks we’ve been saving.</p>
<p>For more information about our award nominated work, <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/contact/">get in touch</a> with the team and see how we can help your business. Or sign up to our newsletter, <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/#popup">The Carloss Chronicle</a>, for the latest news, insights and more from the team.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Just recently, Harrison Carloss got together with <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/net-magazine">Net Magazine</a> for a chat about our four decade history, what&#8217;s in the future for the agency and where we see the industry heading as a whole. Here’s an edited version of that meeting:</p>



<h6> Ne<strong>t Magazine</strong>: </h6>



<p>“Harrison Carloss has been described as both one of Staffordshire&#8217;s oldest and youngest creative agencies. On the one hand, it has a 40-year pedigree as HCL Marketing (Harrison Carloss Ltd), creating a string of successful campaigns for the likes of Dr Martens, Evo-Stik, MHA and Shell. On the other, its acquisition by My Clever Group was followed by a period of transformation, which saw it strengthen its creative and digital services and eventually relaunch under its original name of Harrison Carloss &#8211; but with a new identity. </p>



<p>“Repositioned
as a strategic creative marketing agency focusing heavily on web and digital
transformation, Harrison Carloss now has its eye firmly on the future. We spoke
to creative director Rich Urwin, web developer Joe Ciavucco and digital
designer Luke Brookes to find out what that future looks like.” </p>



<h6> <strong>Net Magazine:</strong> </h6>



<p><strong>“So how did Harrison Carloss come about?”</strong></p>



<h6> <strong>Rich Urwin: </strong></h6>



<p><strong>“</strong>In the 1970s, John Harrison and Michael Carloss started a traditional ad agency. Harrison Carloss was created and found itself well placed to take advantage of the rapid growth in the regional advertising and marketing industry. Over the years the company changed its name to HCL to keep up with moving trends but still identify with its founders. Until its recent acquisition, where it went back to its roots to capitalise on Harrison Carloss and its history.</p>



<p>“We
work together on every project, with everyone having input in each stage of the
process and the projects are so much stronger for it. A creative studio should
be full of humour and character; this ultimately makes your work better and
makes you work harder.”</p>



<h6> <strong>Net Magazine</strong>:  </h6>



<p><strong>“What&#8217;s the web design scene like in Staffordshire? Is there one?” </strong></p>



<h6> <strong>Joe Ciavucco:</strong> </h6>



<p><strong>“</strong>Harrison Carloss is paving the way for web design and development in the area. Outside of the big-agency areas like Manchester and London, creativity can die off, with agencies being more concerned about the speed and profitability of projects than creativity and innovation. </p>



<p>“We
see far too many purchased WordPress templates being thrown onto clients&#8217; sites
in the area, which leaves a huge gap for us to create incredible bespoke
experiences. I can see many other agencies over the next few years hiring new
talent as they move away from basic themes into more bespoke design to try and
keep up with us. </p>



<p>“We&#8217;re
hoping to kickstart the creative industry in Staffordshire and show we do have
a lot of talented people in the area. We&#8217;ve been quite heavily recruiting since
our rebrand. We&#8217;re seeing lots of young talent coming out of Staffordshire
colleges and universities embracing newer web technologies, which is really
great to see and again a sign of the growing popularity of the industry in the
area.”</p>



<h6> <strong>Net Magazine:</strong>  </h6>



<p><strong>“Are you recruiting and, if so, what kind of web designers are you looking for?”</strong></p>



<h6> <strong>Rich Urwin:</strong>  </h6>



<p>“We&#8217;re currently looking for both a full stack and front-end developer. The unique position we&#8217;re in allows new recruits to work on a multitude of high­ profile projects, in different sectors and using multiple technologies.” </p>



<h6> <strong>Net Magazine:</strong>  </h6>



<p><strong>”In what ways do you think your job might change in the 2020s?” </strong></p>



<h6> <strong>Joe Ciavucco:</strong> </h6>



<p>“We&#8217;re getting really excited at the potential projects we have coming in and I can see all the developers here being incredibly busy for the next few years with the projects we have ahead. My job is continuously changing as web technology is always moving forwards at an unstoppable rate, meaning developers have to be consistently learning. I&#8217;m excited for what technologies lie ahead in the 2020s.” &nbsp;</p>



<h6> <strong>Rich Urwin:</strong> </h6>



<p>“As creative director of both Harrison Carloss and My Clever Group, I see my position staying the same but driving the creative forward even more aggressively to push boundaries and create groundbreaking work that makes us stand out. Not all things that convert have to be boring/corporate and we&#8217;re going to prove it.” </p>



<h6> <strong>Luke Brookes:</strong>  </h6>



<p>“It&#8217;s such an exciting time here at Harrison Carloss. I&#8217;m looking forward to working on more full-service projects and launching our current ones. As new clients and colleagues come on board, I&#8217;m looking forward to working with new people and the various challenges ahead!” </p>



<h6>HEY, YOU! YES, YOU!</h6>

<p><strong>It’s been an exciting year here at Harrison Carloss – from our acquisition back in January to our newest recruits joining the team – it’s safe to say 2019 has been our year! And, as a cherry on top of the cake, we’re happy to announce we are a finalist of the prestigious The Drum Agency Business Awards 2019! </strong></p>



<p>We impressed the judges with our entry to the Marketing
Agency of the Year award for agencies with 50 or fewer staff, detailing the <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/projects/">brilliant work</a> we have
done in our 40 year history and the innovation we continue to bring to the
marketing scene. </p>



<h6> What is The Drum? </h6>



<p>The Drum is Europe’s largest media and marketing website,
attracting over 1.4 million unique users and over 200,00 social followers each
month. They pride themselves on helping businesses make informed decisions
about their marketing and showcasing the best of the best. </p>



<p>Their <a href="https://www.agencybusinessawards.com/the-drum-agency-business-awards/agency-business-awards-2019">Drum
Agency Business Awards</a> looks to celebrate the very best run agencies in the
country (including us!) with the aim to make it easier for businesses to trust the
people they depend on for advice. </p>



<h6> We’ve been busy </h6>



<p>Just a year ago, Staffordshire’s oldest established and
longest running creative agency became part of <a href="https://www.myclevergroup.com/">My Clever Group</a> and changed its name
to Harrison Carloss. </p>



<p>Yet so much more than simply changing our name, we began a
profound and total transformation that saw a restructuring in every part of our
operation. </p>



<p>We have built on our offering with world class digital, app development, data analytics and cloud based software solutions, and with 40 years of creative successes behind us, we settled into fantastic new premises and set about completely transforming our services right across creative, web and digital.</p>



<h6> Celebrate good times (c’mon!) </h6>



<p>We’re incredibly proud of the whole team, as well as the amazing clients we’ve worked with who have allowed us to showcase our talents, and have a lot of fun doing it! We can’t wait to join the other <a href="https://www.agencybusinessawards.com/the-drum-agency-business-awards/agency-business-awards-2019">finalists</a> at the awards ceremony in London on the 26<sup>th</sup> November for what is certain to be a brilliant night. Watch this space, folks!</p>

and see how we can help your business. </p>

them working on high-profile projects, creating innovative and distinctive

20,000 sq ft HQ.</p>



<p>HCL is a full-service creative marketing agency whose team has produced a string of highly successful campaigns

culture here at MCG. This is just the beginning of MyCleverGroup’s recruitment process and ongoing investment in
the agency to cement its place as a sector leader in the area and beyond. We’re
building on HCL’s long-standing foundations as we continue to grow our in-house
capabilites, increasing the focus on world-class digital, app development, data
analytics and cloud-based software systems.</p>



<p>Our mission at HCL is to offer our clients a truly first-class
service to go along with the highest levels of creativity and digital

<h3><strong>One of Staffordshire’s longest established marketing companies is reborn after being acquired by MyCleverGroup</strong></h3>



<p>An exciting new era begins for one of Staffordshire’s longest running and most experienced marketing communications companies.</p>



<p>HCL Marketing (Harrison Carloss Ltd.) which first opened its doors in the 1970s, has been acquired by MyCleverGroup, located in the vibrant heart of Festival Park. The move now sees HCL operate out of the world class facility created by MyCleverGroup to help its business-2-business offering grow.</p>



<p>HCL is a full-service creative marketing agency which, over the years, has created a string of highly successful campaigns for clients including Dr. Martens, Evo-stik, MHA, Shell, The ExtraCare Charitable Trust, Arco, Staffordshire Tourism, Churchill China, and many other well known National and regional brands.   </p>



<p><strong>The agency offers a complete range of marketing services including web design, digital marketing, branding and marketing strategy, direct mail, advertising, design for print and print management. </strong></p>



<p>MyCleverGroup’s CEO, Gareth Mobley, said ‘As part of MyCleverGroup, HCL is now in an ideal position to expand and offer its wealth of marketing experience and extensive services to new and existing clients. The agency’s working ethos and track record are a perfect fit with the values of MyCleverGroup as we grow our own capabilites in assisting businesess with marketing and end-to-end digitalisation.</p>



<p>‘MyCleverGroup is expecting a flurry of further key acquisitions and a number of key appointments over the next 12 months to fulfil its mission of helping empower hundreds of businesses using the latest technology. By leveraging clever yet simple technology, marketing and digitalisation, we can help drive top line growth and profitability, while enhancing both customer and colleague engagement.’</p>



<p>MyCleverGroup has already begun investing heavily in HCL, building on its existing stable foundations and growing its in-house capabilites to increase the service offering, with a big focus on digital, app development, data analytics and cloud based software systems.</p>



<p>Gareth continues: ‘It’s often hard for most businesses to understand all of the jargon surrounding the use of tech; the benefits are frequently unclear, and their practical application even murkier. For those reasons we want to make the use of technology in your business simple by creating a one-stop-shop that takes the pain away. This is a hugely exciting time to be a part of MCG, and we are very pleased to have the team at HCL on board. We recently invested £2m in our HQ on Festival park, and we are going to fill it with the area’s top talent.’ </p>
